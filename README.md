# pigmentation

This is a very simple project that I created to start working with DOM manupulation, the way this project works is that it just generate a random background color and change the color name from the hexacode color to it's corresponding name.

"By manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh."

Key concepts covered while working on this project :

1. arrays
2. document.getElementById()
3. document.querySelector()
4. addEventListener()
5. document.body.style.backgroundColor
6. Math.floor()
7. Math.random()
8. array.length
